This project is a typing test website for kids. The purpose is to help young kids learn how to type on a physical keyboard, so they are more adept at using desktop and laptop computers as they grow up. It will incorporate random short sentences. After completion of a sentence, the page will transition into the next sentence for the children to type. An ending page will occur at the end that allows the child to return to the home screen and start over.
