# Kids Typing Test
## Hosted on: https://katelynkunzmann.github.io/typing-test/

This project is a typing test website for kids. The purpose is to help young kids learn how to type on a physical keyboard, so they are more adept at using desktop and laptop computers as they grow up. It incorporates random short sentences, if the typer makes an error the box turns red and the typo count increases. If the typo is corrected, the box returns to gray. There is a "Next" button on the bottom that proceeds to the next sentence for the child to type. Typos are reset to 0.
