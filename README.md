This project is a typing test website for kids. The purpose is to help young kids learn how to type on a physical keyboard, so they are more adept at using desktop and laptop computers as they grow up. It will incorporate a theme/story to go along with the words the children are typing. The home page will have a choice of one or more stories to type. After completion of one typing paragraph, the page will css transition into the next page for the children to type. An ending page will occur at the end of the story that allows the child to return to the home screen and start over.
